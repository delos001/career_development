## Workflow

Documents are loaded just-in-time by skills in the framework repo. The full loading map is defined in `career_development/README.md`.

Do not modify document structure, tag taxonomy, or schema (Added / Last Used / Last Revised metadata, classification line format, narrative metadata block) without updating the corresponding skill and rule files in the framework repo. The schema contract is documented in the `Knowledge Document Schemas` section of the framework `README.md`.
